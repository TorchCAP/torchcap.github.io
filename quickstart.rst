TorchCAP Quickstart
====================

# TorchCAP

## Setup

Build the Docker environment required to run TorchCAP:

```bash
docker build -t torchcap-env .
```

## Profiling hardware

TorchCAP can optionally profile your hardware to collect detailed performance metrics. This enables more accurate cost estimation.

Note: If this step is skipped, TorchCAP will fall back on querying system APIs, which may be less precise.

To profile your cluster:

```bash
bash profile_cluster.sh -o profile.json -n <num_nodes> -d <num_devices_per_node> [-p]
```

This command generates a JSON file containing a cost model specific to your hardware. `-p` is an optional option that generates the plots of the cost models. 

## Running TorchCAP

To run TorchCAP with a specified hardware profile and model with huggingface:

```bash
bash examples/huggingface/run_docker.sh -m facebook/opt-6.7b -e profile.json
```

### Arguments
- `-m`: Huggingface model path (e.g., `facebook/opt-6.7b`)
- `-e`: Path to the hardware profile JSON file generated during profiling
